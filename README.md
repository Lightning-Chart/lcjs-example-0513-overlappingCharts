# JavaScript Multi Chart Canvas

![JavaScript Multi Chart Canvas](overlappingCharts-darkGold.png)

This demo application belongs to the set of examples for LightningChart JS, data visualization library for JavaScript.

LightningChart JS is entirely GPU accelerated and performance optimized charting library for presenting massive amounts of data. It offers an easy way of creating sophisticated and interactive charts and adding them to your website or web application.

The demo can be used as an example or a seed project. Local execution requires the following steps:

-   Make sure that relevant version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is installed
-   Open the project folder in a terminal:

          npm install              # fetches dependencies
          npm start                # builds an application and starts the development server

-   The application is available at _http://localhost:8080_ in your browser, webpack-dev-server provides hot reload functionality.


## Description

Example of a freeform canvas where you can have any number of charts with free control over draw order and positioning.

LightningChart JS supports displaying virtually any number of charts on a single page. You can also freely position, size and overlay them with full control over draw order between charts and other HTML content.

In this example, 20 charts are placed all over the place with 1 HTML canvas element mixed in as an extra complication.
The page can be extended with a scroll bar, and any chart can be dragged around by holding down the mouse and moving. Dragging any panel will bring it to the top of draw order.

Meanwhile, all charts are receiving real-time streaming data and continue to operate normally in terms of panning, zooming and cursor interactions.

**Compared to other web browsers, this example performs extremely poorly on Mozilla Firefox** due to relatively bad implementation of `CanvasRenderingContext2D.drawImage` when source is another canvas element.
